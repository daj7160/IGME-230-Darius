# Sidescrollin' Shooter - Proposal

1. High Concept 
    My idea for this game is Temple Run meets Megaman/Metroid. A sidescrolling, pixelated style(Megaman/Metroid) where you dodge a lot of objects (Temple Run), and shoot baddies that come around. Sort of Jetpack Joyride-esque
2. Genre 
    Genre will be a sidescrolling action/ game with some platforming elements
3. Platform 
    Desktop only
4. Story 
    You're a sheriff trying to respond to the multitude of outlaws in your town, while avoiding all of the hazards set up by them. you must kill outlaws while dodging a bunch of obstacles along the way
5. Aesthetics
  * Graphics - Probably 16 bit
  * Sound - Probably retro-esque, not quite 8-bit

    Sounds for scoring, shooting, game background music, possibly jumping
    
6. Gameplay 
    Your character will auto run, you will need to jump & duck around obstacles, and shoot enemies.
7. Screenshots/Mockups
