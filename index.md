# Sidescrollin' Shooter - Fastest Gun in the West

![Jetpack Joyride](jetpackjoyride.jpg)

Have you ever wanted a challege in games? Have you played games like Temple Run, Jetpack Joyride or Sonic in the past and loved the concept but wanted a little more substance?

### **Welcome to Sidescrollin' Shooter**

The Sidescrollin' Shooter is the fastest gun in the west, but you'll have to maneuver him through multiple obstacles as well as watching your flanks for outlaws. If you don't stay on your toes, you'll be as dead as a can of corned beef

So dust off your six-shooter, put your badge on, and get to runnin', because the town needs you, and it sure isn't big enough for you *and* those outlaws
